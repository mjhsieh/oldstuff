The main documentation for MEAD is this README file, whose main
purpose is to explain what's in the distribution and how to run the
programs.  For a breif outline of the design of MEAD, see the ISCOPE97
paper cited above.  (It's on the FTP site too as iscope-paper.ps)

Please look at the file INSTALLATION even if you have installed a
previous version of MEAD before.  We have switched to the use of a
configure script, rather the the multiple-makefile scheme used before.
Also, the organization of both the source files and the installed
files has changed.

INTRODUCTION

MEAD is a set of software objects for the purpose of modeling the
electrostatics of molecules using a semi-macroscopic picture in
which the solvent and the molecular interior have different dielectric
constants, the boundary between the different dielectric regions is
dependent on the detailed atomic structure of the molecule, and
the electrostatic potential is determined by the Poisson-Boltzmann
equation.  This version of MEAD includes modeling of a membrane
as a low dielectric slab, possibly with a water-filled channel
through a protein in the membrane.

MEAD is written in C++, which is a significant departure from
most molecular software, which is more commonly written in Fortran
or (recently) C.  My purpose in choosing C++ was to explore
the object-oriented programming style that C++ facilitates
and to make a software system that other people could borrow
pieces from and make extensions to in a convenient way.

REPRODUCTION OF PUBLISHED RESULTS

This distribution of MEAD has the programs, data files and parameter
files needed to reproduce the results reported in several
publications.  Files for the pK calculations on the triclinic
structure of lysozyme reported in D. Bashford & M. Karplus (1990)
Biochemistry vol.  29, pp. 10219-25 are in the subdirectory, 
examples/lysozyme.
Files for some of the results reported in D. Bashford & K.  Gerwert
(1992) "Electrostatic Calculations of the pKa Values of Ionizable
Groups in Bacteriorhodopsin" J. Mol. Biol. vol. 224 pp.  473-486, are
in the subdirectory, examples/br.  Data files to reproduce some of the results
from Donald Bashford, David A. Case, Claudio Dalvit, Linda Tennant and
Peter E. Wright (1993) "Electrostatic Calculations of Side-chain pKa
Values in Myoglobin and Comparison with NMR Data for Histidines",
Biochemistry vol. 23, pp. 8045--8056, are in the directory examples/myoglobin.
Some of the test results for the method of calculated solvent
accessibility lattices reported in You and Bashford (1995b),
J. Comp. Chem. vol. 16, pp. 743-757 can be reproduced using the data
files in the subdirectory examples/solvacc.

The input data to reproduce the results for a conformationally
flexible site in lysozyme reported in You and Bashford (1995a),
Biophys. J. vol 69, pp. 1721-1733, are in a separate distribution
file, lysoflex.tar.Z, on the Scripps FTP server.  Similarly the data
files for the results reported in Dillet, Dyson and Bashford (1998)
"Calculations of Electrostatic Interactions and pKa's in the Active
Site of Escherichia coli Thioredoxin" Biochemsitry vol 37,
pp. 10298-10306. are in thioredoxin.tar.gz on the FTP server.  Both
these data sets are quite large since they contain a number of protein
coordinate files.

The computer programs needed to reproduce the results mentioned above
are mostly under apps, although in some cases, problem-specific
shell scripts or perl scripts are in the data-file directories.  For
some of these studies, a version of Paul Beroza's mcti program was
used in a final step.  Mcti is not distributed by the Bashford lab,
although the Scripps FTP currently server has a version of it
under pub/case/beroza/pep/xmcti-1.1.1.tar.Z.  There may be slight
differences between the version of mcti used in house and the one
currently on the FTP server.

ORGANIZATION OF MEAD SOURCES: MEAD AS A LIBRARY:

A long-standing goal of MEAD has been to serve not only as a
collection of useful applications (documented below) but also as an
object-oriented library to allow other researchers to create their own
applications.  Starting with version 2.2.0, this is achieved by
reorginizing the source code directories, and by having an install
procedure that installs MEAD as a library.

Building MEAD causes a static library file libmead.a to be created and
installation puts it in a place like /usr/local/lib.  Also the various
header (*.h) files that are needed to compile a program using the MEAD
library are put in a place like /usr/local/include/MEAD by the
installation procedure.  Applcation programmers then need not put
their programs into the distributed source directory.  Rather, they
can put them in their own directory and put lines like
   #include <MEAD/ElstatPot.h>
and so on, in their source code, and compile using whatever flags are
needed to tell the compiler where to find include files (usually "-I"
on Unix compilers); and link using the appropiate flags to find
libmead (on Unix something like "-L/usr/local/lib -lmead").

In the distributed source directory, the files needed to make
libmead.a are in the directory libmead (which might be renamed or
symlinked to MEAD in some situations).  Applications programs are in
individual subdirectories under apps.  The swig subdirectory pertains
to the new Python interface (see below).  This business of putting
each libarary and application into its own subdirectory seems to be
necessary for many implementations of C++ if either the libraries or
the applications make much use of templates.  It also seems to help
with portability to Windows.

Unfortunately, there is not yet documentation for MEAD as a library.
Your best bet is to look at the source code of some of the simpler
applications like potental or solvate or (getting a bit more complex)
solinprot.  Don't start with multiflex, it's too hairy.


PYTHON INTERFACE:

Recently, we have begun the process of "wrapping" MEAD to make it
available from the Python scripting language.  We have tried to make
the Python interface as closely analogous as possilbe to the C++
interface.  Only a portion of the higher-level parts of the MEAD
library are wrapped at present, and documentation is lacking.  For
more information about the Python wrapping, see the directory, swig,
and the README file therein.  The python wrapping is currently
optional in the building process, see INSTALLATION for more.

We don't yet have documentation for the Python interface, but you can
get an idea by looking at some simple examples in that directory,
sol.py genpot.py and bug.py.  To see a full list of the classes and
functions available (but with no documentation strings), see MEAD.py.

To run the simply python examples, type "python genpot.py", and so on.
This will only work if "make install" has installed the python
interface to MEAD (see INSTALLATION).  If you're just sitting in the
swig directory, but haven't done the install, you'll need to edit the
application files by and change the lines "from PyMead import MEAD" to
"import MEAD"

NOTE: bug.py will cause a Python run-time error to be signalled.
That's what it's supposed to do!  This means that errors dedected
within the MEAD C++ code are get translated into python exceptions
which scripts can catch and handle, rather than bringing down the
whole python system.

The README file in the swig subdirectory has a description of the
methods used to wrap MEAD for Python.  The Python interface is
largely the work of Thi Thien Nguyen.


This distribution includes five programs implemented using the MEAD
object library: potential solvate, solinprot, multiflex and
sav-driver.  It also includes the program redti, which does not use
the MEAD objects.  The next five sections are fairly brief
descriptions of the purposes and particular features of the five
MEAD programs.  Detailed discussion of most command line options and file
formats is deferred to the sections, "THE COMMAND LINE" and "FILE
FORMATS", because many of the programs share many of the same options
and formats.  Finally the program, REDTI is described.

POTENTIAL

Calculates the potential due to the molecule, MolName (a name
specified on the command line), whose coordinates radii, and charges
are specified in a file MolName.pqr, and writes to standard output its
values at points specified by the MolName.fpt file.  The units of the
output potentials are input charge units divided by input length
units.  For typical PDB-derived input files, this would be
proton-charge/Angstrom.  In that case, to get kcal/mol/proton-charge,
multiply by 331.842.

The -CoarseFieldOut and -CoarsefieldInit options will cause the
coarsest potential lattice to be written to, or initialized from, an
AVS (Advanced Visualization System) "field" file.  By default, the
units are as above for the the output potentials, but if you give the
option "-AvsScaleFactor f", where f is a floating point number, the
field will be scaled by that factor.

Potential requires the files MolName.pqr and MolName.ogm.  MolName.fpt
is not strictly required, but if neither the .fpt file nor the
-CoarseFieldOut option are used, the program produces no output of the
calculated potentials.  The -epsin flag is mandatory.

See below for general explanations of files, arguments and flags.


SOLVATE

Solvate calculates the Born solvation energy of a molecule -- that is,
the difference in the electrostatic work required to bring its atom
charges from zero to their full values in solvent versus vacuum.
MolName (a name specified on the command line) is the molecule(s) for
which the the calculation is to be done and whose coordinates radii
and charges are specified in a file MolName.pqr Solvate requires a
MolName.pqr file and a MolName.ogm file (see below) as inputs.  THE
-epsin FLAG IS MANDATORY.  This is a change from older version.  I
found that people got confused when the default epsin (previously 4.0)
was contrary to people's expectations; so no more default behavior!
The Born solvation energy is written to standard output in kcal/mole.
Physical conditions and units for I/O can be set by flags on the
command line (see below).  By default solvate assumes we are going
from vacuum (eps=1) to water (eps=80).  Note that solvate uses the
-epssol and -epsvac flags rather than the -epsext flag to control
solvent conditions.  You can try it out on a sphere to check agreement
with the Born formula.  See the born subdirectory.

A NEW FEATURE of solvate is turned on with the -ReactionField flag.
In this case, a MolName.fpt file is expected to contain points at
which you want the value of the reaction field.  It will be written
out to the file, MolName.rf.


SOLINPROT

USAGE: solinprot [flags] solute protein

Calculates the "solvation" of the molecule named by solute (for which
there must be solute.pqr and solute.ogm files) inside the molecule
named by protein (for which the must be a protein.pqr file) which is,
in turn, in some solvent (water, by default).  The interior of the
solute is presumed to have the dielectric constant, epsin1 (given by
the -epsin1 flag) and regions interior to the protein but exterior to
the solute are presumed to have the dielectric constant, epsin2 (given
by the -epsin2 flag) and regions exterior to both protein and solute
are presumed to have dielectric constant, epsext (80.0 by default).
The protein may contain charges and their interaction with the solute
will contribute to "solvation energy."  The solvated energy is
calculated relative to a vacuum calculation in which the dielectric
constant has a value of epsin1 inside the solute and epsvac (1.0 by
default) outside.

The calculation works like this: First the potential due to the solute
charges (call them rho_solute) in the above described dielectric
environment is calculated.  Call this potential phi_sol.  Next the
potential due to rho_solute is calculated in the vacuum dielectric
environment described above.  Call this potential phi_vac.  The
reaction field component of the solvation energy is then,
(rho_solute*phi_sol - rho_solute*phi_vac)/2, where "*" indicates a
suitable sum or integral of charge times potential.  So far, this is
the same as the solvate program except for the three-dielectric
environment on the solvated side.  We also need the contribution due
to protein charges, rho_protein, interacting with the solute:
rho_protein*phi_sol.

The flags are similar to those for the solvate program except that the
-epsin1 and -epsin2 flags (see below) are mandatory and the -epsin
flag is forbidden.  The -epsext flag is used instead of -epssol for
specifying the solvent dielectric.  (Is this a bug?).  The
-ProteinField flag, described below, is also available.

MULTIFLEX

Multiflex does the electrostatic part of a titration calculation for a
multi-site titrating molecule.  It can do single-conformer calculations
based on the methods described in Karplus and Bashford (1990) and
Bashford and Gerwert (1992) which assumes a rigid molecule, or
it can included limited conformational flexibility by the method
of You and Bashford (1995a).  In the latter case, the user must
supply the coordinates for the conformational variants and the
corresponding non-electrostatic energies.  This can be done with
a program like CHARMM.

For single-conformer calculation, multiflex works like the old
multimead program.  It takes MolName.pqr, MolName.ogm, MolName.mgm,
MolName.sites and MolName.st files as inputs (see below) and as its
main outputs, produces a MolName.pkint file, which contains the
calculated intrinsic pK's; a MolName.g file, which contains site-site
interactions in units of charge squared per length; and a MolName.summ
file which summarizes the self and background contributions to the
intrinsic pK of each site.  The MolName.pkint file and the Molname.g
file can be used directly as input to redti, the program for
calculating titration curves.  Multiflex also produces a file,
MolName.sitename.summ for each titrating site which contains some
summary information that is mainly interesting for multi-conformer
(flexible) calculations; and it produces a large number of *.potat
files, which are binary files that are useful if a job is interrupted
and restarted (see below).  The -epsin flag is mandatory.  Other flags
can be used to change units and/or physical conditions or include a
membrane.

For the "flexible" calculations which involve multiple conformers,
multiflex needs the input files described above but it also needs
additional files: For each flexible site there must be a file,
MolName.sitename.confs, in which "sitename" is constructed from the
MolName.sites file by the procedure,

  "7  GLU"  --> "GLU-7"

These .confs files tell about the possible conformers of that site.
They contain lines of the form:

  confname  mac_non_elstat_energy  mod_non_elstat_energy

where "confname" is the name of the conformer and the next two entries
are non-electrostatic energies of the conformer in the macromolecule
and in the model compound corresponding to this site.  The energies
must be given in kcals/mole unless the -econv flag (see below)
has been given to change the energy units.

For each conformer named in a .confs file, there must be a .pqr file
having the coordinates, charges and radii for the whole protein in
that conformer.  It must have the file name:

   MolName.sitename.confname.pqr

You might need a lot of of .pqr files, for example, the You and
Bashford calculations on lysozyme had 36 conformers for each of 12
sites and one MolName.pqr file is always needed so 433 .pqr files were
needed for each titration calculation.

Flexible and single-conformer sites can co-exist in the same molecule.
The way multiflex tells the difference is that flexible sites have
confs files and single-conformer files don't.


SAV-DRIVER

This program gives a demonstration of the SolvAccVol facility of MEAD
which was described in our paper, You and Bashford (1995b),
J. Comp. Chem. vol. 16, pp. 743-757.  It is described in more detail
in the file, README.SAV

THE COMMAND LINE:

The programs generally have the command line syntax:

program_name [flag value]... [flag]... MolName

where MolName is the base name for various I/O files.  For example,
"multiflex [flags] foo" will expect to find files named foo.pqr,
foo.ogm, foo.mgm, and foo.sites, and will create foo.pkint, foo.g and
foo.summ, as well as writing to standard output.  The flags are used
to set values pertaining to the physical conditions being modeled and
the units used in the input files and the other flags.  The default
assumptions regarding units are that all inputs with dimension of
length (coordinates, grid spacing) are in Angstroms, all inputs with
dimensions of charge are in protons, concentrations are in moles/liter
and temperature is in Kelvins.

The flags and their default values are:

     -epsin f	 	Dielectric constant of molecular interior
                        In old versions of MEAD this had a default value,
                        but this caused confusion, so now you must
                        specify epsin explicitly.

     -epsext f	 80.0	Exterior dielectric constant (potential only).


     -epssol f   80.0   The dielectric constant of one of the
                        external media in the solvate program,
                        presumably the solvent.  (multiflex and solvate)

     -epsvac f    1.0   The dielectric constant of the other
                        external media in the solvate program,
                        presumably the vacuum.  (solvate only)

     -solrad f    1.4	Solvent probe radius used in rolling ball
			procedure to determine contact surface
			which is taken as the boundary between
			epsin and epsext.  (Angstroms, by default)

     -sterln f	   2.0	Ion exclusion layer thickness which is added
			to atomic radii to determine region inaccessible
			to salt so that kappa term in PB equation
			is zero.  (Angstroms, by default)

     -ionicstr f  0.0	Ionic strength (moles/liter, by default).

     -T f	 300.0	Temperature (Kelvins by default)

     -ReactionField     (solvate only) Flag to write values of the
                        solvent reaction field potential at space
                        points specified by the user.  The point should
                        be in an input file named MolName.fpt in which
                        points are listed in the format, "(x, y, z)"
                        Corresponding reaction field potential values
                        will be written to a file MolName.rf.

     -epsave_oldway     Revert to the old style of "epsilon averaging"
                        This refers to the problem of deciding what
                        value of the dielectric to use for the region
                        between two potential lattice points in the
                        finite-difference method.  The new way involves
                        inverse averaging and is similar to a proposal
                        by McCammon.  The old way is a simple mean.
                        The new way is significantly more accurate;
                        the option to do it the old way is only provided
                        for the sake of reproducing old experimental
                        results.  It is not recommended otherwise.

     -converge_oldway   Revert to the old way of testing for convergence
                        of the SOR method of solving the finite-difference
                        representation of the Poisson--Boltzmann equation.
                        The new method gives improved long-range accuracy
                        for large lattices, but at a sometimes substantial
                        computational cost.  See the NEWS file for further
                        discussion.

     -kBolt f	 5.984e-6 (protons squared)/(Angstrom * Kelvin)
			The Boltzmann constant in units of charge unit
			squared per length unit per temperature unit.
			You must adjust this if you don't use the
			default units of length, charge and temperature

     -econv f    331.842  (kcal/mole)/(protons squared/Angstrom)
                        Conversion factor for going from energy units
                        of (charge units squared)/(length unit) to
                        to whatever energy units you want for your output.
                        You must adjust this if you don't use the
			default units of length and charge, or if you
			want output in different energy units.

     -conconv f	 6.022214e-4 ((particles/cubic Angstrom)/(moles/liter))
			Conversion factor for going from concentration
			units used for ionic strength to units of
			particles per cubic length unit.  You must adjust
			this if you don't use the default units of length
			and concentration.

     -site N            Do a titration calculation only for the N-th
                        site that is named in the .sites file.
                        (multiflex only).

     -CoarseFieldOut  nm  For the first (coarsest) lattice specified
                        in the .ogm file, write the lattice potential
                        values to a file, nm.fld, which is an AVS
                        "field" format.  (potential only)

     -CoarseFieldInit  nm  For the first (coarsest) lattice specified
                        in the .ogm file, read the lattice potential
                        values from the AVS file, nm.fld, and use them
                        to initialize the coarse lattice. (potential only)

     -nopotats          Prevent multiflex from creating any .potat
                        files.  However, multiflex will still make
                        use of .potat files found in the current
                        directory (see discussion of .potat files below)

     -membz f1 f2       Set up a membrane parallel to the x-y plane
                        extending from z=f1 to z=f2.  (multiflex only).
                        The "membrane" is a low-dielectric slab: all points
                        within the specified z range are assigned the
                        dielectric constant, epsin. (multiflex only)

     -membhole f1 [f2 f3]   Make a cylindrical "hole" through the
                        membrane with radius f1 and central axis in
                        the z direction x=f2 and y=f3 (or x=y=0 if
                        f2 and f3 are not given).  The meaning of the
                        hole is that points that are inside the hole but
                        outside the protein interior are assigned
                        a dielectric constant of epssol.  This is useful
                        for calculations on membrane proteins that make
                        channels or have water-filled cavities, such as
                        bacteriorhodopsin.  (multiflex only)

     -blab1
     -blab2
     -blab3             Controls how verbose the program will be.  -blab3
			is most verbose, and no blab flag at all is least
			verbose.  In the latter case only essential info
			on the run parameters and results are printed
			to standard output.  Writing to things like .pkint
			files are not effected.


FILE FORMATS

MolName.pqr :

	Atomic coordinate file similar to a PDB (Protein Data Bank)
	file but with atomic charge and radii in the occupancy and
	B-factor columns, respectively.  More specifically, lines
	beginning with either "ATOM" or "HETATM" (no leading spaces)
	are interpreted as a set of tokens separated by one or more
	spaces or TAB characters.  The tokens (including the leading
	ATOM or HETATM are interpreted as follows:

          ignored ignored atname resname resnum x y z charge radius chainid

        The chainid token is optional, and any tokens beyond that are
        ignored. Tokens can be of arbitrary length, but must not
        contain spaces or tabs. Lines that do not begin with "ATOM" or
        "HETATM" are ignored. The programs make no distinction
        between ATOMs and HETATMs (note above that token 1 is
        ignored).  No atname-resnum-chainid combination can occur more than
        once. (Atom data is stored internally in associative arrays
        and syntax of things like .st files depend on ability of
        atname-resnum-chainid combination to uniquely specify an atom.) 

	Note that the .pqr format does not support some PDB-isms such
	as a altLoc fields, and a one-character chainID between
	resName and resSeq.  Doing so would break the whitespace
	separated tokens convention that allows for easy processing
	with perl scripts, etc.  Instead we put "chainID" in a
	position more or less analogous with the PDB segID.  (Maybe we
	should have called it segID.)


MolName.ogm, MolName.mgm :

	Specification for the grid method.  Each line specifies a
	level of a focussed set of grid calculations, starting with
	the coarsest and going to the finest.  Lines have the format,

        centering  grid_dimension  grid_spacing

        where grid_dimension is an odd integer greater than 1
	specifying the number of points along the edge of the grid;
	grid_spacing is a positive floating point number specifying
	the spacing between grid points; and centering is
	ON_ORIGIN, ON_GEOM_CENT or ON_CENT_OF_INTR, according to
	whether the grid is to be centered on the origin of the
	coordinate system, the geometric center or the "center of
	interest" which, for multiflex is on one of the titrating
	charges in the site being calculated (see .st files, below)
	and for other programs is on the origin (so ON_CENT_OF_INTR
	not much use with selfenergy).  Multimead needs the .ogm file
	to specify the grid method for the macromolecule and the .mgm
	file to specify the grid method for the model compound.  Other
	programs need only the .ogm file.  For proper cancelation of
	grid effects, the finest levels for the model compound and the
	macromolecule must use the same grid spacing and centering
	style.  The grid center can also be specified explicitly by
	giving a point in the format, "(x, y, z)" as the
	centering.

MolName.fpt:

        Specifies that "field points" for which the potential program
        should sample and write out the potential.  The x, y, z
        coordinates should be specified as three numbers written in
        the usual floating-point way, and separated by any amount of
        white space.  Optionally, the three numbers can by surrounded
        by parenthesis and separated by commas.  Points are separated
        from each other by white space.  Line breaks are considered
        the same as any other white space.

MolName.sites (multiflex only):

	This file specifies which sites in a macromolecule are titrating
	and what kind they are.  For each site it contains a line of the
	form,

	resnum  site_type chainid

	where resnum is the residue number of the site and will be
        matched to the residue number field of the atoms in the
        MolName.pqr file, chainid is to be matched to the chainid
        given in MolName.pqr, and site_type refers to site_type.st
        files.  Usually, site_type will be similar to a residue type
        name.  The chainid field is optional, but you must be
        consistent in either including or omitting it in MolName.sites
        and MolName.pqr.

site_type.st: (multimead and multiflex only)

	Multiflex expects a file of the name site_type.st to specify
	details concerning each site_type that appears in the
	MolName.sites file.  The first line contains one floating
	point number which is the model compound pK for that type of
	site.  All remaining lines are of the form,

	resname atomname prot_charge deprot_charge

	where resname and atomname, along with the resnums given in
	the .sites file match an atom in the .pqr file that is part of
	a titrating site, prot_charge is that charge of this atom in
	the protonated state and deprot_charge is its charge in the
	deprotonated state.  It is expected that the sum of all
	prot_charge subtracted from the sum of all deprot_charge
	will equal one.

	I plan to extend this file's syntax to allow a regular
	expression to be given that will specify how a model compound
	is to be made from the protein atom coordinates.

Something.potat : (output)

	This is a binary output file produced by some programs.  It
	contains the potential at each atom of MolName (or a model
	compound) generated by some set of charges.  Variations of
	"something" may denote charge states, sites, conformers,
	solvated or vacuum or uniform dielectric environments,
	depending on the application.  Atomic coordinates and radii
	and the generating charges are also included for the sake of
	consistency checking.  These files allow multiflex, etc. to
	avoid recalculating a lot of things when all you want to do is
	add or alter some site, but you must be careful about site
	names, which .potat files you leave sitting around, and so on.
        Specify the -blab2 flag for a blow-by-blow account of attempts
	to read and write .potat files in multiflex.

MolName.pkint, MolName.g MolName.sitename.summ: (multiflex)

	Described in the multiflex summary above.


REDTI:

Redti solves the multiple site titration curve problem given a set of
intrinsic pK's (MolName.pkint) and a site-site interaction matrix
(MolName.g) using the Reduced Site method described by Bashford &
Karplus (1991) J. Phys. Chem. vol. 95, pp. 9556-61.  Its command line
syntax is:

redti [-cutoff val] [-pHrange val val] [-dry] MolName

where the "val" are numbers giving the protonation fraction cutoff for
the reduced site method, the bottom of the pH range to be covered and
the top of the range, respectively.  The defaults are 0.05, -20.0 and
30.1, respectively.  (Yes, that's an extreme pH range).  The -dry flag
causes redti to do a "dry run" in which it prints the number of sites
to be included in the reduced site calculation at each pH point.  This
is useful for checking whether a calculation will require a prohibitive
amount of CPU time since CPU time will go exponentially in the reduced
site number.

Redti is written in C rather than C++.
